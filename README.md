# django_saml2_sp

Minimal working example for getting a Django application authenticating with Azure (Entra ID) SAML2.

Really intended as a proof of concept for authenticating [University at Buffalo Center for Computational Research](https://www.buffalo.edu/ccr.html)'s [ColdFront](https://github.com/ubccr/coldfront), but I needed a simpler application to focus on.

Uses [Fang Li](https://github.com/fangli)'s [django-saml2-auth](https://github.com/fangli/django-saml2-auth) atop a stripped-down version of [Mozilla Development Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)'s [Django Tutorial: The Local Library website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website).
